# Cleaner

This small tool recursively searches a directory for audio files, images and
other files, scanning the audio files to check if they contain necessary tags
(mp3 or flac).

This is a work in progress project used to help learn the Rust programming
language.

As such, there is likely non-idiomatic code in here, beware!
